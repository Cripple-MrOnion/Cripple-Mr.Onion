This is a console app for the playing the game Cripple Mr.Onion that was in the Disworld Series written by Terry Pratchett, the rules on how to play the game can be 
found at http://discworld.wikia.com/wiki/Cripple_Mr_Onion.
This project was written in Visual Studio and in a combination of c# and java script.
We currently have a deck shuffler which creates a deck object that is shared by all players, we can deal cards and discard cards, we also have the ability to get the
players' names and have tried to set up a turn based game.
Hopefully the final push on here is going to have the full turn based game but if not what we were trying to do was to let the players enter the total number of player
and then thier names. The first player will take theri turn once thier done they will hit the "next player" button and a transition screen will appear till the second 
player is ready and this will continue till all players and all the turns have been played.
