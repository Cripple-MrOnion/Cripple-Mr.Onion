    <p>Terry Pratchett was a fantasy writer that was known for creating a wonderful and eccentric world filled with equally wonderful and eccentric characters and one of the games that ran through a lot of his books was the game Cripple Mr. Onion. The game is played with an 8 suit deck of cards: Spades, Clubs, Hearts, Diamonds, Axes, Tridents, Roses, and Doves. The game is played as combination of Blackjack and Poker, the cards are dealt similarly to Blackjack though each player gets 10 cards (5 face up and 5 face down). After being dealt the cards are then treated similarly to Poker in that you look for card combinations, the highest card combination will win, and you can bet any time during your turn.</p>
